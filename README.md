- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Ali Ibrahim from Lebanon. A second engineering student at Lebanese International University (LIU).
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in working on more projects in Java Language to enrich my knowledge. In addition to open more opportunities in my career.
- ðŸŒ± I have finished the fundamentals of Java and currently I'm learning  the object oriented programming (OOP) at university but I don't just want to gain what the university gives. I'm looking to expand my knowledge and practice here.
